text-adventure
==============

Simple C++ text-adventure for studying C++

Original code by: Ben Keen/bigjimbeef

https://github.com/bigjimbeef/text-adventure.git

I intend to add some features to this code to learn more about the structure of C++ programs. I think this is a very nice piece of code and it was just what I was looking for.

Thanxx Ben !!
